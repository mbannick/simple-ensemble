# A Simple Ensemble Model for Descriptive Epidemiology

This is a package and demo for creating a simple ensemble model using `rpy2` to fit linear mixed models and `scikit-learn` to do cross-validation. The data used in `notebooks/ensemble_example.ipynb` is available from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, stored in the Global Health Data Exchange here: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2017.
