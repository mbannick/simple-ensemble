# A Simple Ensemble Model for Descriptive Epidemiology

This is a package and demo for creating a simple ensemble model using `rpy2` to fit linear mixed models and `scikit-learn` to do cross-validation. The data used in `notebooks/ensemble_example.ipynb` is available from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, stored in the Global Health Data Exchange [here](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2017).

The ensemble modeling methodology is a simplified version of that used in the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study detailed by Foreman et al 2012 [here](https://pophealthmetrics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-7954-10-1).
